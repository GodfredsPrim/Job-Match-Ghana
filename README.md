# Daakye Job Match (v.0)

**Daakye Job Match** is a web application built with Streamlit to connect Ghanaian youth—both unskilled and skilled/educated (including university/college graduates)—to diverse job opportunities across Ghana’s 16 regions. The app prioritizes small communities (70% of jobs) and mining-affected regions (40%, e.g., Western, Ashanti, Ahafo) to provide sustainable alternatives to illegal mining (galamsey) and reduce urban migration. It offers a range of jobs, from low-paying informal roles (e.g., Okada Rider, ₵800–₵2,000) to high-paying professional roles (e.g., Software Developer, ₵12,000–₵25,000), empowering youth to build better futures.
